## 🤖 Ralph Loop Instructions

**Never ask questions.** Make reasonable decisions based on the plan above and project conventions.

**Each iteration:**
1. Implement one small piece
2. Update scratchpad.md with progress in your session directory
3. Commit working code

**When 100% done:**
1. Validate all changes are complete
2. Create completion.md in your session directory summarizing:
   - What was accomplished
   - Final state of the implementation
   - Any remaining TODOs or future work
   - Total commits made
3. This signals completion to Ralph
