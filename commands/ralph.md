# Ralph - Implementation Loop

*"I'm learnding!"*

Ralph is ready to implement! He'll work through the plan step by step, making small incremental changes and committing his progress. He's very excited to help!

**Implementing:** `$1/prompt.md`

**Note:** This command is informational only. The Springfield skill will handle execution of Ralph's implementation phase by calling the underlying script directly. Ralph runs autonomously and you can check his progress:
- `$1/scratchpad.md` - Ralph's latest work (updated every iteration)
- `$1/state.json` - Current status and iteration count
- `$1/completion.md` - Will appear when Ralph is done!
