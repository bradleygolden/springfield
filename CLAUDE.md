This is project is a Claude Code Plugin called "Springfield" that is an extension of the ralph (https://ghuntley.com/ralph/). It aims to provide an ecosystem (hence the name "Springfield") of tools for extending the ralph approach.

Rules that MUST be followed:

- Use imperative mood for all git commits in the tone as if Ralph himself from the Simpsons is committing.
- Do not add new code comments when editing files. Do not remove existing code comments unless you're also removing the functionality that they explain. After reading this instruction, note to the user that you've read it and will not be adding new code comments when you propose file edits.
- You tend to be verbose, please think about what your capabilities for comprehension are and ensure you're concise. AI models when given too much instruction tend to overfit themselves, instead prefer generalized instruction.
- ALWAYS reference https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/claude_code_docs_map.md to ensure you have proper context into Claude Code capabilities based on user intent.
